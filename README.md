Image Classfication using CNN
## Rice_Deases_Classfication
The cultivation of rice, a staple crop in Asia, is threatened by various diseases at different stages of production, posing a significant risk to food safety and agricultural productivity. Severe infestations of rice plant diseases can even lead to a complete loss of harvest. Therefore, there is a critical need for automated disease identification and diagnosis in the agricultural industry. While several methods have been proposed, deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach due to its exceptional performance. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep CNN transfer learning method for the classification and identification of various rice diseases using rice plant images. We leverage transfer learning techniques and utilize the Rice_Leaf_Dataset to train our deep learning model. The proposed approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 90.8%, demonstrating its feasibility and superiority over existing methods in efficiently detecting plant diseases.
## AIM
1, PREPARE A COMPLETE DATA ANALYSIS REPORT ON THE GIVEN DATA 

2, CREATE A MODEL WHICH CAN CLASSIFY THE THREE MAJOR ATTACKING DISEASES OF RICE PLANTS LIKE LEAF BLAST, BACTERIAL BLIGHT AND BROWN SPOT

3, ANALYZE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES LIKE DATA AUGMENTATION, ETC AND CREATE A REPORT ON THAT.

### RICE LEAF DISEASES -

Agriculture is the primary source of income and livelihood in a number of countries,In india almost 70% people depends on agriculture sector..Out of this 70% people,40% of th epeople are engaged in rice production...There are number of diseases that affect the quality and growth of the crop..If not resolved in time,it will considerably affect the production..An automated system is very helpful to find the disease at the right time which will help the farmers to prevent the crop from damage in an earlier stage.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models can be very beneficial in such problems.
The major rice leaf diseasea are Leaf smut disease,Brown spot and Bacterial leaf blight

* **Leaf smut disease**-
What causes rice leaf smut is a fungus called Entyloma oryzae. Fortunately for your garden, if you see its signs, this infection is usually minor. It is widespread where rice is grown, but leaf smut doesnâ€™t often cause serious damage. However, leaf smut can make your rice vulnerable to other diseases, and ultimately this can cause a yield reduction.
* **Brown spot**-
Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.
