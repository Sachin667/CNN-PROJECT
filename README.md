Image Classfication using CNN
## Rice_Deases_Classfication
The cultivation of rice, a staple crop in Asia, is threatened by various diseases at different stages of production, posing a significant risk to food safety and agricultural productivity. Severe infestations of rice plant diseases can even lead to a complete loss of harvest. Therefore, there is a critical need for automated disease identification and diagnosis in the agricultural industry. While several methods have been proposed, deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach due to its exceptional performance. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep CNN transfer learning method for the classification and identification of various rice diseases using rice plant images. We leverage transfer learning techniques and utilize the Rice_Leaf_Dataset to train our deep learning model. The proposed approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 90.8%, demonstrating its feasibility and superiority over existing methods in efficiently detecting plant diseases.
## AIM
1, PREPARE A COMPLETE DATA ANALYSIS REPORT ON THE GIVEN DATA 
2, CREATE A MODEL WHICH CAN CLASSIFY THE THREE MAJOR ATTACKING DISEASES OF RICE PLANTS LIKE LEAF BLAST, BACTERIAL BLIGHT AND BROWN SPOT
3, ANALYZE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES LIKE DATA AUGMENTATION, ETC AND CREATE A REPORT ON THAT.
